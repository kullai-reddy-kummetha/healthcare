		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The introduction of the pervasive healthcare paradigm has enabled the awareness towards the independent living of elderly people and the need for constant medical supervision of chronic patients or habitants at remote, isolated or underserved locations. In this context, advanced electronic healthcare services are required to be made available through a network anytime, anyplace and to anyone. A medical assistive environment on the other hand concerns the utilization of pervasive and ubiquitous technologies for delivering the above services. Wireless technologies enable the real time transmission of data about a patient's condition to caregivers. Numerous portable devices are available that can detect certain medical conditions—pulse rate, blood pressure, breath alcohol level, and so on—from a user's touch.</p>
		
		<h2>Description of the project</h2>
		<p>In this project, we are monitoring various parameters of the patient using internet of things. In the patient monitoring system based on Internet of things project, the real-time parameters of patient’s health are sent to cloud using Internet connectivity. These parameters are sent to a remote Internet location so that user can view these details from anywhere in the world.<p>

		<p>There is a major difference between SMS based patient health monitoring and IOT based patient monitoring system. In IOT based system, details of the patient health can be seen by many users. The reason behind this is that the data needs to be monitored by visiting a website or URL. Whereas, in GSM based patient monitoring, the health parameters are sent using GSM via SMS.</p>

		<h2>Working of the project</h2>
		<p>IOT patient monitoring has 3 sensors. First one is a temperature sensor, second is Heartbeat sensor and the third one is accelerometer sensor. This project is very useful since the doctor can monitor patient health parameters just by visiting website or URL. And nowadays many IOT apps are also being developed. So now the doctor or family members can monitor or track the patient health through the Android apps.</p>
		
		<p>To operate IOT based health monitoring system project, you need a Wi-Fi connection. The microcontroller or the Arduino board connects to the Wi-Fi network using a Wi-Fi module. This project will not work without a working Wi-Fi network. You can create a Wi-Fi zone using a Wi-Fi module or you can even create a Wi-Fi zone using Hotspot on your smartphone. The Arduino UNO board continuously reads input from these 3 senses. Then it sends this data to the cloud by sending this data to a particular URL/IP address. Then this action of sending data to IP is repeated after a particular interval of time. For example in this project, we have sent data after every 30 seconds.</p>
